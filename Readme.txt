🏨 Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes a hotel booking dataset and prepares it for machine learning tasks such as predicting whether a booking will be canceled or honored.
The focus is on data cleaning, feature engineering, and preprocessing to ensure reliable modeling.

⚙️ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing Steps

Identify and Visualize Missing Values

Used missingno and heatmaps to show patterns of missing data.

Filled missing values:

company and agent → replaced with 0 or "None"

country → imputed with mode or "Unknown"

Handle Outliers

Detected using boxplots and the IQR method.

For adr, capped extreme values (e.g., any value > 1000 set to 1000).

Remove Duplicates

Identified duplicate rows and dropped them.

Fix Data Types

Converted date columns (e.g., reservation_status_date) to proper datetime.

Created new columns like total_guests (sum of adults, children, babies).

Feature Engineering

Created is_family (True if children or babies > 0).

Encoded categorical variables:

Low-cardinality (e.g., meal, market_segment) → One-Hot Encoding

High-cardinality (e.g., country) → Frequency Encoding / Grouping rare values into "Other".

Prevent Data Leakage

Dropped reservation_status and reservation_status_date (not available at booking time).

Final Preparation

Defined features (X) and target (y = is_canceled).

Split dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%), using stratify=y to preserve class distribution.

📊 Tools & Libraries

Python

Pandas – data manipulation

NumPy – numerical operations

Matplotlib / Seaborn – visualization

Missingno – missing value visualization

Scikit-learn – data preprocessing and train/test split

🚀 Next Steps

Train machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).

Evaluate performance with metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and AUC.

Deploy the model for real-world booking cancellation prediction.
